            <p class="blog-post-meta">April 10, 2022</p>

            <p><b> Nowadays we can turn off the lights and fans in our house, sitting
                in the office by just clicking a button on the phone. But how is this
                possible? The answer to this is Wireless Communication. There are many
                types of Wireless Communication but this article focusses only on the
                communication between two NodeMCUs which gives a solution to the above
                problem. </b></p>
            <hr>
            <p> NodeMCU is an open source IoT platform. It includes firmware which runs
                on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC(System On Chip) from Espressif Systems, and hardware which is based on the
                ESP-12 module.</p>
            <h2> About ESP8266 </h2>
            <p> The ESP8266 WiFi Module is a self contained SoC with integrated TCP/IP
                protocol stack that can give any microcontroller access to your WiFi
                network. The ESP8266 is capable of either hosting an application or
                offloading all Wi-Fi networking functions from another application
                processor. Each ESP8266 module comes pre-programmed with an AT command
                set firmware, meaning, you can simply hook this up to your Arduino
                device and get about as much WiFi-ability as a WiFi Shield offers (and
                that's just out of the box)! The ESP8266 module is an extremely cost
                effective board with a huge, and ever growing, community.
                
                This module has a powerful enough on-board processing and storage
                capability that allows it to be integrated with the sensors and other
                application specific devices through its GPIOs with minimal development
                up-front and minimal loading during runtime. Its high degree of on-chip
                integration allows for minimal external circuitry, including the
                front-end module, is designed to occupy minimal PCB area. The ESP8266
                supports APSD for VoIP applications and Bluetooth co-existance
                interfaces, it contains a self-calibrated RF allowing it to work under
                all operating conditions, and requires no external RF parts.
            </p>
            <h2> Scenario </h2>
            <p>
                There are two Microcontrollers (NodeMCUs). One is the server and the other
                is a client. The client sends a request and the server performs some action based on the request
                (either it can perform some task or give back some information to the
                client). Here, the client will send a request to turn an LED on or off.

                WiFi capabilities for NodeMCU comes from the ESP8266 WiFi module present in it.

                A NodeMCU can be coded in two modes, Station mode and Soft Access Point
                (Soft AP) mode.
            </p>
            <h2> Who is who? </h2>
            <p>
                Devices that connect to Wi-Fi networks are called stations (STA).
                Connection to Wi-Fi is provided by an access point(AP), that acts as
                a hub for one or more stations. The access point on the other end is
                connected to a wired network. An access point is usually integrated with
                a router to provide access from a Wi-Fi network to the internet.

                ESP8266 modules can operate as a station, so we can connect it to the
                Wi-Fi network. It can also operate as a soft access point (soft-AP), to
                establish its own Wi-Fi network. When the ESP8266 module is operating as
                a soft access point, we can connect other stations to the ESP module.
                ESP8266 is also able to operate as both a station and a soft access
                point mode. This provides the possibility of building, for example, mesh
                networks.
            </p>
            <h2> NodeMCU as an AP </h2>
            <p>
                <p><img src="../static/assets/image1.jpg"></p>

                Set the SSID and password of your Access point. They can be anything but
                <b>should contain at least 8 characters</b>>. Here we have added
                password for secured communication but it can be done without a password
                as well.

                <p><img src="../static/assets/image2.jpg"></p>

                Start the access point. Here myIP is the IP address of the AP. LED is
                connected to pin 13 or D7.

                <p><img src="../static/assets/image3.jpg"></p>

                Here the first print statement prints the number of stations connected
                to our access point. Then read the request sent by the client.

                <p><img src="../static/assets/image4.jpg"></p>

                Based on the request either turn on the LED or turn it off.
            </p>
            <h2> NodeMCU as a Station </h2>
            <p>
                <p><img src="../static/assets/image5.jpg"></p>

                Host contains the IP address of the AP (Access point).

                Here the SSID and password should be the same as the AP because we have to
                connect this Station to the WiFi of the AP.(Here these names appear to
                be contradicting. But it is OK as they are just identifiers.

                <p><img src="../static/assets/image6.jpg"></p>

                Connect the Station to the WiFi of the AP. The program won't proceed
                further until the wifi is connected.

                <p><img src="../static/assets/image7.jpg"></p>

                Connect to the host and send the request. Here, we follow the standard
                HTTP GET request format. We are continuously sending requests with a
                delay of 3 seconds.
            </p>
            <h2> Output </h2>
            <p>
                <p><img src="../static/assets/image8.jpg"></p>

                This is the output from the Serial monitor of the Access Point.
                
                <p><img src="../static/assets/image9.jpg"></p>
                
                This is the output from the Serial monitor of the station.
